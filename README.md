Motorola Recriutment Task

Hi!

I'm PhD geology student at AGH. Recently I've realized that is not what I want to do in my life so I decided to change my career. That is why I (try to) code ;)
I have a tiny expierience with Python and SQL but your task was my first touch with C#.

Hope to see you soon
